# Embedded education in hackathon project

Pedagogical strategy to integrate a form of training related to a subject within a hackathon project, linked to the idea of project-based learning.

The will is to shape a strategy to structure a learning process during a hackathon and think about the elements that will help reinforce this process.

## Workflow

The following workflow is designed to help assimilate concepts progressively by continuously linking them with the project, where we build the foundations to be extended. A learning process where it's going to be useful to mobilize [learning areas](hackathon-learning-area.md) in the best possible ways.

It will be a combination of structured and unstructured learning.

> ⚠️ Attention to cognitive engagement.

1/ Project introduction (basic notions)
- **Participants' presentation**: questions on their relation with the topic
- **Explanation of the project**: introduce a basic set of notions integrated into this explanation

2/ Seeking a global understanding of the challenge (notions complexity)
- **Focus on the hackathon problematic**: Expanding knowledge on notions and diving into their complexity

3/ Direction choice for the hackathon project (notions reflexivity)
- **Collective debate and ideation to define the work project**: imagine through notions mobilization, questioning possibilities

4/ Development of the hackathon project (notions application)
- **Design the project and shape its strategy**: create with and apply the accumulated notions

## Participants motivation

The aim is to encourage participants' motivation to foster the appropriation of knowledge and involvement in the project. A variety of dimensions come into play.

**The objective would be to bring them into a personal inquiry**, to make it possible to adopt an investigative posture based on a project linked to personal sensitivity.

**Motivation factors:**
- Authentic, interesting and valuable problems/topics
- Interest in learning and understanding the subject, rather than outcomes (grade, price, etc.).
- Possibility to work with others
- Appropriation of the subject
- Feeling of competence
- Autonomy
- Balanced cognitive engagement

**Personal interest:**
- Skills development (perceived and acquired)
- Use of skills and knowledge
- Professional development (network, opportunities, etc.)

**Collective interest:**
- Societal impact of the project
- Participation in a global project
- Contribution to common good and/or digital commons

## Trainer/Mentor Role

The trainer's role will be to nurture this learning process, both by providing knowledge and by contributing to the participants' reflective attitude. They should be in a learning and research posture, with a high level of cognitive activity in this complex environment.

A stance that highlights possible mistakes and celebrates learning.

**Activities:**
- Share information to give learning opportunities
- Help to examine and expand ideas
- Feedback
- Providing contradictory reflections and predictions
- Encourage the use of the learning and meta-cognition process
